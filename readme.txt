== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add a new note? =

A new note can be added in two ways.

- Open 'Screen Options' on your dashboard, in the right corner you'll find a button called 'Add note'.
- Or you can add a new note from within an existing note. When hovering over a note there will show an black bar at the bottom of that note. There is an '+' within that bar where you can add a new note.

= Can I change the colors =

You could change the colors by overriding the style from another stylesheet. If you need help with this, ask in the support forums.
